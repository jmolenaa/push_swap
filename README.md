# Push_swap

The Push_swap project aims to sort data on a stack using a limited set of instructions and achieving the lowest possible number of actions.  
The goal is to learn about sorting algorithms.

## Functionality

The program takes a list of numbers and sorts them from lowest to highest.  
To do this it uses 2 stacks and a set of predetermined operations that change the positions of the numbers on the stacks. The [operations](#lol)

## Chapter II - Introduction
Push_swap is a straightforward algorithm project focusing on sorting data. The project aims to explore complexity and sorting algorithms, making it an essential step in a developer's journey.

## Chapter III - Objectives
The main learning objectives of the project include rigor, using C, and implementing basic algorithms with a focus on understanding their complexity.

## Chapter IV - Common Instructions
This chapter provides the common instructions for all projects, including adhering to the Norm, handling errors, writing a Makefile, using a libft, and submitting the work to the assigned Git repository.

## Chapter V - Mandatory Part
The mandatory part involves writing a program called "push_swap" that sorts integers in a stack using a set of instructions: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, and rrb. The program should display the smallest list of instructions to sort the stack.

## Chapter VI - Bonus Part
The bonus part allows students to create their own "checker" program to verify whether the instructions generated by the push_swap program correctly sort the stack. The checker program will execute the instructions on the stack and display "OK" if the stack is sorted, or "KO" otherwise.

## Chapter VII - Submission and Peer-evaluation
The project should be submitted to the assigned Git repository. The bonus part will be assessed only if the mandatory part is successfully completed without any issues.

Feel free to explore the complexity of sorting algorithms and find the most efficient solutions for sorting data on a stack. Good luck!
